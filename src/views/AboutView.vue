  <div class="about">
    <h1 class="green">I am passionate about game development and creating amazing user experiences.</h1>
    <h3>My projects range from web games to desktop apps and scripts for doing things like playing MP3s.<br><br> I enjoy using both C# and C++ development languages and have very fond memories of learning to code in the C development language.<br>
    <br>My current project is a 2D game based on the classic game BattleShip. I am using Unity and C# to create the game and will be using the Unity Asset Store for some of the graphics and sound effects.<br>
    <br>If you want a preview of BattleShip without Unity check it out at the repository <a href="https://github.com/Turtle-Head/BattleShip">here.</a> It can be downloaded and will run by launching the game from the included exe file.<br>
