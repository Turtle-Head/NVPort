    <h2 class="green">I am passionate about game development and creating amazing user experiences.</h2>
    <h3>My projects range from web games to desktop apps and scripts for doing things like playing MP3s.<br><br> I enjoy using both C# and C++ development languages and have very fond memories of learning to code in the C development language.<br>
    <br>My current project is a 2D game based on the classic game BattleShip. I am using Unity and C# to create the game and will be using the Unity Asset Store for some of the graphics and sound effects.<br>
    <br>If you want a preview of BattleShip without Unity check it out at the repository <br>
    <div class="green"><a href="https://github.com/Turtle-Head/BattleShip">BattleShip.</a></div> It can be downloaded and will run by launching the game from the included exe file.</h3><br>
